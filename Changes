          [ WILL TOTALLY BREAK YOUR SETUP! ]

          "locations" are now "networks" and make sense

          a host node can have multiple interfaces, across multiple networks,
          which will result in a split horizon

          the "world" location is now the "FALLBACK" network, the "ALL" network
          performs a similar role
